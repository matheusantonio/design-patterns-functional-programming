  abstract = {The second of three books published by the Center for Environmental Structure to provide a "working alternative to our present ideas about architecture, building, and planning," <I>A Pattern Language</I> offers a practical language for building and planning based on natural considerations. The reader is given an overview of some 250 patterns that are the units of this language, each consisting of a design problem, discussion, illustration, and solution. By understanding recurrent design problems in our environment, readers can identify extant patterns in their own design projects and use these patterns to create a language of their own. Extraordinarily thorough, coherent, and accessible, this book has become a bible for homebuilders, contractors, and developers who care about creating healthy, high-level design. "Brilliant....Here's how to design or redesign any space you're living or working in--from metropolis to room. Consider what you want to happen in the space, and then page through this book. Its radically conservative observations will spark, enhance, organize your best ideas, and a wondrous home, workplace, town will result"--San Francisco Chronicle. A handbook designed for the layman which aims to present a language which people can use to express themselves in their own communities or homes, and to better communicate with each other.},

  comment = {Alexander himself, in his seminal book (Alexander et al, 1978), describes a pattern called “Network of Learning”. The premise of this pattern is that in a society which emphasises teaching, learners become passive and unable to think or act for themselves. He argues that creative, active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasises learning instead of teaching. The solution he proposes is to replace the structures of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, with decentralised processed of learning which engage learners through contact with many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home, professionals will to take on the young as helpers, older children, museums, youth groups, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. This argument resonates with Ilich's call for “deschooling society” (1971) and conviviality (1973).

"Every creative act relies on language. It is not only those creative acts which are part of a traditional society which rely on language: all creative acts rely on pattern languages: the fumbling inexperienced constructions of a novice are made within the language which he has. The works of idiosyncratic genius are also created within some part of language too. And the most ordinary roads and bridges are all built within a language too....



In order to make patterns explicit, so that they can be shared in this new way, we must first of all review the very complex structure of a pattern....



As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves. ...



As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant." (Alexander et al. 1977)

"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."},
